# Word Counter
Construct a program and prove that it works that counts the number of occurrences of words in a file.

Shortly motivate your approach.

If the input is a file containing:

```
do the things, you do so well
```
The output should be a file containing:

```    
do: 2
the: 1
things: 1
you: 1
so: 1
well: 1
```
